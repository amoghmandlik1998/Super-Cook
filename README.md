# Super-Cook 

Super Cook is a mobile application that acts as an ingredient to recipe reverse search engine. It allows you to search for common recipes based on a list of Ingredients that you already have at home. 

Add Ingredients to your Ingredients List by looking through categories, or searching for them. Click the 'Go' button to generate a list of possible recipes that can be made (10,000 Recipes currently). You can click the toggle button to find Recipes that are only one ingredient away. 

Built with Expo, Firebase and React Native. Database has been re-factored (using Local JSON DB). Uses custom O(nk) algorithm that provides instant search.
