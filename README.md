# Super-Cook 

Project for practising React Native + Firebase. Super Cook allows you to search for common recipes based on Ingredients that you already have at home. 

Add Ingredients to your Ingredients List by looking through categories, or searching for them. Click the 'Go' button to generate a list of possible recipes that can be made (2000 Recipes at the moment)

Built with Expo, Firebase and React Native. Search time is a bit lengthy and I will likely refactor database soon.
